House Price Prediction using Multivariate Linear Regression
Overview
This project predicts house prices based on features like size, number of bedrooms, and age using Multivariate Linear Regression.

Prerequisites
Google Colab (for running the project)

Install required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Steps to Run the Project
Open Google Colab and upload the notebook (house_price_prediction.ipynb).

Upload Dataset (house_prices.csv) to Google Colab.

Install Dependencies (if not already installed).

Load and Clean Data – Handle missing values and preprocess categorical features.

Perform Data Analysis – Visualize distributions and correlations.

Train the Model – Use Linear Regression with selected features.

Evaluate Performance – Check accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score.

Visualize Predictions – Compare actual vs. predicted prices.

Results & Next Steps
The model predicts house prices based on key features.

Performance can improve by adding more relevant data (e.g., location factors).

The model can be extended using advanced algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost.
